# filterr
Image filtering with pure CSS. Simple CSS experiment built to give me, a lazy designer/dev, the initiative to learn Git and Github. Also this was fun to make, and we like fun.

List of CSS3 filters:

	filter: brightness(100%); 0min 200max

	filter: contrast(100%); 0min 200max

	filter: grayscale(0%); 0min 100max

	filter: hue-rotate(0deg); 0min 360max

	filter: invert(0%); 0min 100max

	filter: saturate(100%); 0min 200max
	
	filter: sepia(0%); 0min 100max
	
Blur and opacity filters omitted. Blur can get choppy, and opacity didn't really seem that useful so both filters were omitted.
